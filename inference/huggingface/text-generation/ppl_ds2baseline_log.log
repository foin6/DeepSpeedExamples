We also show that our method can learn a language model from a small corpus with a high efficiency.

Learning a language model from a small corpus is a challenging problem. The most common approach is to use a large corpus to train a language model. However, this approach is not always effective. For example, the language model trained from a large corpus may not be effective for a small corpus. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn a language model from a small corpus.
