 Large language models are useful for many tasks, but they are not always available. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learning a language model from a small corpus. We use a simple but effective method to learn a language model from a small corpus. We show that our method can learn a language model from a small corpus with a high accuracy. We also show that our method can learn a language model from a small corpus with a high efficiency.

Learning a language model from a small corpus is a challenging task. The most common approach is to use a large corpus to train a language model. However, this approach is not always effective. For example, the language model trained from a large corpus may not be effective for a small corpus. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learn a language model from a small corpus.
